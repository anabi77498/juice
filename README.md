# Juice Finance App

*A joint project by Asad Nabi, Giorgi Berndt, and Nathan Maidi*

Juice Finance allows for organization, management and insights of your bank account and assets. It allows you to handle multiple bank accounts and get a clear understanding of your financial status, projected financial changes and insights related to real estate and stock assets. Our goal was to create a financial service that can replicate banking features and allow you to experiment with the money in your account without any risk! 

Accounts registered as local JSON files structured as a yoJson tree. 

The interface is via the terminal and allows for frequent use and saving of your changes.
