# Juice Finance App üí∞ 

Juice Finance allows for organization, management and insights of your bank account and assets. It allows you to handle multiple bank accounts and get a clear understanding of your financial status, projected financial changes and insights related to real estate and stock assets. Our goal was to create a financial service that can replicate banking features and allow you to experiment with the money in your account without any risk!
